# 🩻 Medical Image Enhancement and Malignancy Segmentation System (MIEMSS)

**An AI-driven medical imaging solution designed with a product-focused approach, balancing technical innovation with usability, scalability, and clinical impact.**

---

## 📌 Problem & Vision
Medical X-ray interpretation is **time-consuming** and **prone to oversight**, especially in high-volume clinical settings.  

Our vision for **MIEMSS** was to **bridge the gap between AI research and real-world medical workflows** by creating a solution that:
- **Enhances diagnostic accuracy** via image denoising and anomaly detection.
- **Saves time** for radiologists through automation.
- **Delivers actionable insights** via visual and textual outputs.

This project was conceived, designed, and implemented **from scratch**, with **end-to-end ownership of product lifecycle**:
- Market need identification.
- Requirement gathering (SRS).
- Technical feasibility & architecture design.
- MVP development and testing.
- Roadmap planning for future iterations.
